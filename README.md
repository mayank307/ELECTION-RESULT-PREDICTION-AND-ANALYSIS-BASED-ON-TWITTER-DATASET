# ELECTION-RESULT-PREDICTION-AND-ANALYSIS-BASED-ON-TWITTER-DATASET
Using Random Forest Algorithm to predict election results, based on twitter dataset.
.
• The project aims to bring new insights into the survey based platforms.
• Here we have tried to collect raw data from twitter and then preprocess the data for our usage.
• We classified wide range of data into narrow segments which we felt would most likely influence the result.
• Applied Random Forest Algorithm on the data to precisely see which candidate would win from a region.
• We have also applied the concepts of AUC or Area Under the Curve, which maps graphs for various aspects and variables that would influence the results.
• We have achieved an accuracy score of above 90%, and our main focus was to decrease the computational cost along with making it accessible for large amount of data.
